The most popular financial management method, stocks, has attracted so many investors to 
participate. The risks of stock investment are relatively high as compared to different 
investments.
In the era of big data, deep learning and machine learning for analyzing and predicting stock 
market prices and trends have become even more popular than before.
We take live data from Yahoo Finance API and propose comprehensive customization of feature 
engineering and deep learning-based model for analyzing and predicting price trends of stock 
markets. Traditional stock forecasting models use forecasting models based on stock time series 
analysis. The proposed solution is comprehensive as it includes pre-processing of the stock 
market dataset, utilization of feature engineering techniques, combined with customized deep 
learning algorithms for stock market price trend prediction. We conducted comprehensive 
evaluations on frequently used deep learning models and conclude that our suggested solution 
outperforms due to the analysis part and different feature engineering that we built. The system 
achieves overall high accuracy and good result for stock market price prediction. With the 
detailed design and evaluation of prediction, trends, and data pre-processing methods, this work 
contributes both in the financial and technical domains.

We are predicting the closing stock price of any given organization, we have developed a 
website for predicting closing price of various using LSTM algorithm. We have imported 
data using the yahoo finance API and achieved above 90% accuracy for these predictions.
Future Scope
- Adding sentiment analysis as a factor to contribute to prediction would make the 
results more accurate and the user would get more realistic results.
- Along with stock market, crypto currency prediction may also be integrated in 
order to make the website a one stop portal for various forms of investments.
